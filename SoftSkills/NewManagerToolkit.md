# New Manager Toolkit

## Format
45 min talk with Q&A? 

## Brainstorm
- What is it about this topic that gets you fired up?
    + I was a first time manager, and given no support, no guidance. I had been seen as an individual contributor that knew how to get things done. I motivated others, and I had a vision for what was possible. But those things are different than being a manager of people. But because I had those skills, my CEO thought I could lead a team of people. I was unprepared for many of the people dynamics that came with managing. My first two years of management I was naive, and we skated by. By year three I had new problems, and had exhausted all internal resources for support. I want to help others not have to fumble their way through their first year of management. So these are the things I wish I would have known on day 1.
- Why is this important to you?
    + Management impacts real lives. We're involved in how they go home at night to be with their family and live the rest of their lives. We're impacting their happiness and sense of self-worth. It's not something I want to take lightly, but it's also something we shouldn't take too seriously (your reports are, in the end, in charge of their own lives)
- Why would this be important to others?
    + It's a common trend to see successful individual contributors promoted to places of people managementâ€”often times unprepared and/or without support. They want resources, tools, guidance, someone to talk with.
- What are 2-3 points you'd like to share with others on that topic?
    + One-on-ones: What are they, why are they important, and how to do them.
    + Painting Done // Setting expectations
    + Retros//SWOT


## Audience
If you're a first time manager, if you want to be a manager, if you want to improve your management skills, if you are a seasoned manager and want to be available as a mentor to other managers... this talk is for you. (Open space to follow)


## Outcomes/Conclusions
What will the audience get out of this talk? What do I want them to come
away with?

- So many times individual contributors rise to the ranks of leadership, and are made managers without much training, coaching or mentorship. How do you navigate becoming the managers of your peers? How do you keep your sanity? How do you grow in your own career while supporting both your team and your company? Through sharing about my first three years of [no training] management, hopefully you can learn a few things that will give you guidance, reassurance, and TOOLS to go back to work next week feeling energized and equipped.
